            <h3>Networking Services</h3>
            <p>Are you looking for networking services from the basics such as setting
                up of LANs, routers and switches to more complex services such as network 
                monitoring, troubleshooting and security management? Look no further as I
                got you covered. I have knowledge and undersanding of networks and also 
                undertaken courses in networking ranging from the basics covered in CCNA,
                intermediate level of CCNP and other more advanced programs. Basically, I 
                have pursued CCNA, CCNP, MCSE just to mention a few. My experience ranges 
                from working as a junior network administrator working under the leadership 
                of a senior administrator with activities such as setting up LANs, WLANs, 
                assigning IP addresses to network components using subnets, setting up wireless 
                access points, voice over IP configuration for orgaization's telephone networks
                just to mention a few. I also undertook network management basically monitoring 
                and troubleshooting the networks with the chance to use some network management 
                tools which were useful such as intrusion prevention systems and intrusion detection
                systems. Occasionally I would also attend to service desk helplines
                thanks to knowledge obatained from my COMPTIA+ certification. My experience in 
                network security ranges from setting up of firewalls, configuring antivirus software 
                to host computers, updating their operating systems and softwares just to mention the 
                basics. More advanced security practices included taking advantage of tunneling techniques
                available through VPNs. Through network security, I got the chance to understand cloud
                computing which inspired me to pursue a certification in AWS and Azure.
